## Step 4: Use onOne Software Mask Pro 4.1.4 Tools
 
onOne Software Mask Pro 4.1.4 provides you with 12 tools to mask everything from large backgrounds to the finest details in hard to mask areas. Here are some of the main tools and their functions:

- **Magic Brush**: This tool allows you to paint away the colors that you do not want in your image, leaving a natural transition between the subject and background. You can adjust the tolerance and feather settings to control how much color is removed.
- **Color Range**: This tool allows you to select a range of colors that you want to keep or remove from your image. You can use the eyedropper tool to sample colors from your image, or use the color picker to choose colors manually.
- **Pen**: This tool allows you to draw precise paths around your subject, creating a vector mask that can be edited and refined later.
- **Chisel**: This tool allows you to refine the edges of your mask, removing any edge halos or fringes that may occur. You can use the edge detection mode to automatically find and smooth the edges, or use the manual mode to brush over the edges yourself.
- **Blur**: This tool allows you to blur the edges of your mask, creating a softer and more realistic transition between the subject and background.
- **Erase**: This tool allows you to erase any unwanted parts of your mask, restoring the original image.

## Step 5: Save and Apply Your Mask
 
Once you are satisfied with your mask, you can save it as a separate file, or apply it directly to your image. You can also preview how your mask will look on different backgrounds by using the composite preview mode.
 
To save your mask, go to File > Save As and choose a file format and location. You can save your mask as a Photoshop document (.psd), a TIFF file (.tif), or a PNG file (.png).
 
To apply your mask, go to File > Apply and choose an option. You can apply your mask as a new layer, as a layer mask, or as an alpha channel.
 
After applying your mask, you can close onOne Software Mask Pro 4.1.4 and return to Photoshop. You can then edit your image further, or export it as a final product.
